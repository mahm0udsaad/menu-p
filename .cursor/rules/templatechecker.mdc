description:# PDF Menu Template System Implementation

## Primary Objective
You are responsible for implementing a complete PDF menu creation system that processes templates from `@pdf-templates-metadata.json` and generates dynamic, accurately styled PDF menus.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Template Processing
- Load and parse all templates from `@pdf-templates-metadata.json`
- Validate template structure and required fields
- Handle template inheritance and dependencies
- Support multiple template formats (layouts, styles, components)

### 2. Dynamic Data Integration
- Implement dynamic value injection for all template variables
- Support real-time data binding from external sources
- Handle menu items, prices, descriptions, categories, and metadata
- Ensure data validation and sanitization before injection

### 3. Style Management
- Apply dynamic styling based on template configurations
- Support responsive layouts and font scaling
- Handle color schemes, typography, and spacing dynamically
- Maintain visual consistency across all generated PDFs

### 4. PDF Generation Pipeline
- Create end-to-end workflow from template editing to final PDF output
- Implement template preview functionality
- Generate high-quality, print-ready PDF files
- Support batch processing for multiple menus

## Success Criteria
- All templates receive their designated data values accurately
- Styling is applied consistently and dynamically
- Generated PDFs match template specifications exactly
- System handles errors gracefully with meaningful feedback
- Performance is optimized for real-time generation

## Expected Deliverables
1. Complete template processing engine
2. Dynamic data injection system
3. PDF rendering pipeline
4. Error handling and validation mechanisms
5. Testing suite to verify accuracy of all generated outputs

Ensure every component works seamlessly together to produce professional, accurate PDF menus from the template system.
