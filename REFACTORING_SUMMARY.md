I will now perform a deep-dive analysis of the codebase to understand the application's
  features and implementation directly from the source code. I will set aside the build and linting issues
  and focus entirely on the application's logic.

  My analysis will be structured as follows:

   1. Entry Point & Main Layout: I'll start with app/page.tsx and app/layout.tsx to understand the
      application's entry point, overall structure, and global components.
   2. Authentication & Onboarding: I'll examine the app/auth/ and app/onboarding/ directories to map out
      the user authentication flow and the new user experience.
   3. Core Feature: Menu Management: I will analyze the app/menu-editor/, app/menus/, and the various
      components under components/ to understand the complete lifecycle of a menu: creation, editing,
      viewing, and data structure (types/menu.ts).
   4. PDF Generation Engine: I'll investigate app/api/menu-pdf/generate/route.ts and the supporting files
      in lib/pdf-server-components/ to understand how PDFs are generated.
   5. Payment System: I will review the code in app/api/paymob/ and lib/paymob.ts to understand the
      payment integration.
   6. Database Schema: I'll analyze the .sql files in the scripts/ directory to reverse-engineer the
      database schema.

  I will begin by examining app/layout.tsx and app/page.tsx.

 ╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
✦ I have analyzed app/layout.tsx and app/page.tsx and can report the following:

  `app/layout.tsx` - The Application Shell:

   * Global Structure: This file establishes the foundational HTML structure for the entire application,
     including loading the "Inter" font for a consistent look and feel.
   * Theming: It wraps all pages in a ThemeProvider, indicating a sitewide theming system (e.g.,
     light/dark mode) is in place.
   * Authentication Core: It creates a server-side Supabase client to fetch the user's session. This
     session data is then passed to an AuthHandler component, which likely manages the user's
     authentication state on the client side. This is a robust and secure way to handle authentication.
   * UI Feedback: A Toaster component is included, which provides a system for displaying toast
     notifications for user actions.

  `app/page.tsx` - The Entry Point:

   * Role-Based Rendering: This page acts as a router. It checks if a user is logged in using a
     server-side Supabase client.
   * Authenticated Users: If the user is logged in, it renders a DashboardRedirect component, sending them
     directly to their dashboard.
   * Unauthenticated Users: If the user is not logged in, it displays the HomeWithPricing component, which
     serves as the public-facing landing page.

  Summary:

  The application's entry point is well-structured. It uses a server-first approach to handle
  authentication, which is a modern and secure practice. The code is modular and component-based,
  separating concerns effectively. The application correctly funnels users to either the marketing/pricing
   page or their dashboard based on their login status.

  My next step is to investigate the user's journey after the landing page. I will now analyze the
  authentication and onboarding process by examining the contents of the app/auth/ and app/onboarding/
  directories.

  I'll start by listing the files in the app/auth/ directory.

 ╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
✦ The directory structure for app/auth/ is logical and follows standard conventions for authentication
  flows. I see dedicated sections for sign-up, login, forgot-password, reset-password, and a callback for
  handling authentication redirects.

  To understand the implementation, I will now read the primary file from each of these directories. I'll
  start with the user registration, login, and password reset flows, and then examine the OAuth callback
  handler.

 ╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
✦ I have analyzed the authentication files. Here is a summary of the authentication flow:

   * User Registration (`app/auth/sign-up/page.tsx`): This page displays a SignupForm component, providing
     the user interface for creating a new account.
   * User Login (`app/auth/login/page.tsx`): This page uses a LoginForm component for existing users to
     sign in.
   * Password Recovery: The system includes a standard, two-step password recovery process:
       1. `app/auth/forgot-password/page.tsx`: A ForgotPasswordForm allows users to request a password
          reset link via email.
       2. `app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx`: A ResetPasswordForm allows users to set a new password
          after following the reset link.
   * Authentication Callback (`app/auth/callback/route.ts`): This is a critical API route that handles the
     server-side OAuth callback from Supabase. After a user authenticates (either via email/password or a
     third-party provider), Supabase redirects them here with a temporary code. This route securely
     exchanges that code for a permanent user session and then redirects the user to the /onboarding page.

  Summary of Authentication:

  The authentication system is robust and follows best practices. It uses a standard email/password flow,
  a secure password reset mechanism, and a server-side callback to finalize the authentication process.
  The immediate redirection to an onboarding flow for new users is a great user experience choice.

  Next Step: The Onboarding Experience

  I will now analyze the onboarding process that new users experience after signing up. I'll start by
  examining the app/onboarding/page.tsx file.
 ╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
 │ ✔  ReadFile app/onboarding/page.tsx                                                                    │
 ╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
✦ I have analyzed the app/onboarding/page.tsx file. Here is the breakdown of the onboarding process:

  Onboarding Logic:

   1. Authentication Guard: The page first ensures a user is logged in. If not, it redirects them to the
      login page.
   2. Profile Check: It then queries the restaurants table to see if a profile already exists for the
      logged-in user.
   3. Conditional Flow:
       * Existing Users: If a restaurant profile is found, the user is immediately redirected to their
         /dashboard. This prevents users from having to go through the onboarding process more than once.
       * New Users: If no restaurant profile exists, the page renders the OnboardingForm component, which
         is responsible for collecting the initial restaurant details.

  Summary of Onboarding:

  The onboarding process is a streamlined, one-time setup for new users. It correctly identifies users who
   have not yet created a restaurant profile and guides them through the necessary form. This is an
  efficient and user-friendly approach to getting new customers started.

  Next Step: The Dashboard and Core Menu Functionality

  Now that I understand the user's entry into the application, I will investigate the main dashboard and
  the core menu management features. I will start by examining app/dashboard/page.tsx to see the user's
  main landing area after logging in.
 ╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
 │ ✔  ReadFile app/dashboard/page.tsx                                                                     │
 ╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
✦ I have analyzed app/dashboard/page.tsx. Here is the breakdown:

  Dashboard Logic:

   1. Server-Side Data Fetching: This page acts as a data-loading orchestrator. It uses server-side
      actions (getDashboardData, getPublishedQrCards) to fetch all the necessary information for the
      user's dashboard before the page is rendered. This is an efficient approach that improves
      performance.
   2. Robust Error Handling: The page includes solid error handling. If data fetching fails or the user
      is not properly authenticated, it intelligently redirects them to the login page or another
      specified location.
   3. Data Delegation: All the fetched data (restaurant details, published menus, QR codes, and user
      information) is passed as props to a single client-side component: DashboardClient.

  Inferred `DashboardClient` Functionality:

  The DashboardClient component is responsible for rendering the entire user interface of the dashboard.
  Based on the data it receives, it will display:

   * The user's restaurant information.
   * A list of their published menus.
   * A list of their generated QR codes.
   * The main navigation for accessing other features of the application.

  Summary:

  The dashboard is built using a modern and efficient architecture. It uses a server component to handle
  data fetching and a client component to handle the interactive UI. This separation of concerns is a best
   practice in Next.js development. The dashboard serves as the central hub for the user, providing an
  at-a-glance view of their content and the primary navigation for the application.

  Next Step: The Menu Editor

  I will now analyze the core feature of the application: the menu editor. I will start by examining
  app/menu-editor/page.tsx and the types/menu.ts file to understand how menus are structured and edited.

 │    **Processed Files:**                                                                                │
 │    - `app/menu-editor/page.tsx`                                                                        │
 │    - `types/menu.ts`                                                                                   │
 ╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
✦ I have analyzed the menu editor and its underlying data structure. Here is my report:

  types/menu.ts - The Menu Blueprint

  This file provides a comprehensive and well-structured definition of the entire menu data model.

   * `Menu`: The top-level object contains not just basic information like title and currency, but also
     detailed settings for theme, font, background, and footer, indicating a high degree of customization.
   * `Category`: Each category can be ordered and can have its own background image.
   * `MenuItem`: Each item can be ordered, marked as available, and can have its own image.

  The level of detail in these types shows a clear vision for a highly customizable and powerful menu
  editor.

  app/menu-editor/page.tsx - The Editor's Entry Point

  This file acts as the data loader and entry point for the menu editing experience.

   * Server-Side Data Loading: It efficiently fetches all necessary data on the server: user session,
     restaurant profile, a list of all menus, and the specific menu being edited.
   * Robust Guard Clauses: It includes strong checks to ensure that only authenticated users with a valid
     restaurant profile can access the editor. It gracefully handles cases where a menu isn't found.
   * Delegation to `MenuEditorServer`: It passes all the fetched data to the MenuEditorServer component,
     which is responsible for rendering the actual editor interface.

  Inferred MenuEditorServer Functionality

  Based on the code, the MenuEditorServer component is the core of the menu editing experience. It likely
  provides:

   * A Comprehensive UI: A user interface for editing every field defined in types/menu.ts.
   * Live Preview: A real-time preview of the menu that updates as the user makes changes.
   * Tabbed Navigation: A tabbed interface to organize the various editing options (e.g., content, design,
     settings).
   * Save/Update Logic: The functionality to persist all changes to the database.

  Summary of Menu Editor

  The menu editor is a sophisticated and feature-rich part of the application. The data model is
  well-designed to allow for deep customization, and the architecture of the editor itself is robust,
  using server-side rendering for performance and a component-based structure for maintainability.

  Next Step: PDF Generation

  I will now investigate the PDF generation feature. I'll start by examining
  app/api/menu-pdf/generate/route.ts to understand how the backend handles PDF creation.
 ╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
 │ ✔  ReadFile app/api/menu-pdf/generate/route.ts                                                         │
 ╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
✦ I have analyzed the PDF generation route, and it is an impressively robust and well-engineered feature.

  PDF Generation Analysis (app/api/menu-pdf/generate/route.ts)

  This is not a simple PDF generator. It's a complete, resilient, and observable microservice for creating
   PDFs.

  Key Implementation Details:

   1. React for Templating: The system uses React to render menu data into an HTML string
      (PDFReactRenderer.renderTemplateWithReact). This is a powerful choice, allowing for the creation of
      complex, dynamic, and easily maintainable PDF templates using familiar component-based architecture.

   2. Playwright for Rendering: It uses a headless browser (Playwright) to convert the generated HTML
      into a PDF (generatePDFFromMenuData). This ensures high-fidelity rendering that can handle complex
      CSS and layouts accurately, just like a modern web browser.
   3. Proactive Health Checks: Before any generation task, the system checks the health of the Playwright
      browser instance. If the browser is in a bad state, it is automatically reset. This is excellent
      proactive error prevention.
   4. Intelligent Retry Logic: If the initial PDF generation fails, the system automatically resets the
      browser and attempts the entire process one more time. This makes the service highly resilient to
      transient issues.
   5. Robust Timeouts: Both the HTML rendering and the final PDF generation steps are wrapped in
      timeouts. This prevents a single request from hanging and bringing down the service.
   6. Smart Caching & Storage: Successfully generated PDFs are uploaded to a Supabase Storage bucket, and
      their metadata is saved to a menu_pdfs table. This allows for near-instant retrieval of previously
      generated PDFs, saving significant server resources.
   7. Graceful Fallbacks: If uploading the PDF to storage fails, the system doesn't just fail the
      request. Instead, it falls back to sending the generated PDF file directly to the user in the
      response.
   8. Detailed & Actionable Error Handling: The error handling is top-notch. It distinguishes between
      different types of errors (timeouts, browser crashes) and returns specific, appropriate HTTP status
      codes (504 for timeout, 503 for service unavailable) and a retryable flag to the client.
   9. Service Observability: The GET endpoint provides a list of available templates and, more
      importantly, a health check parameter. This turns the API into an observable service that can be
      monitored for uptime and health.

  Summary of PDF Generation:

  This is a production-grade PDF generation service. It's built with reliability, resilience, and
  performance in mind. The combination of React for templating and Playwright for rendering is a powerful
  and modern approach.

  Next Step: Payment Integration

  I will now analyze the final core component of this SaaS application: the payment system. I will start
  by investigating the app/api/paymob/ directory to understand how payment processing is handled.

 │                                                                                                        │
 │    Listed 1 item(s).                                                                                   │
 ╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
✦ I see the app/api/paymob directory contains an auth subdirectory. This structure suggests the payment
  flow begins with an authentication step, likely to obtain a token from the Paymob API before processing
  any transactions.

  I will now examine the contents of the app/api/paymob/auth directory to understand this initial step of
  the payment process.
 ╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
 │ ✔  ReadFolder app/api/paymob/auth                                                                      │

 ╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
✦ Okay, the auth directory contains a route.ts file, which will be the API endpoint for the Paymob
  authentication step.

  To get the full picture of the payment integration, I will now read the contents of both this route.ts
  file and the lib/paymob.ts file, which should contain the core Paymob API interaction logic.

│  > what's Paged.js and how we can benefit from in this app  ?  │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Of course. That's an excellent and insightful question. Let's break down what Paged.js is and how it
  could be a game-changer for this specific application.

  What is Paged.js?

  Paged.js is an open-source JavaScript library that acts as a "polyfill" for missing print and paged
  media features in web browsers. In simple terms, it allows you to create beautifully formatted,
  paginated documents (like a book, a magazine, or a multi-page menu) using standard web technologies
  (HTML and CSS).

  It's designed to implement the W3C's Paged Media CSS specifications. These are special CSS
  rules—like @page, page-break-before, running headers, and footnotes—that are intended for print but
  are not supported by browsers for on-screen rendering. Paged.js reads this special CSS and
  re-renders your HTML content into a paginated preview directly in the browser.

  How Can This App Benefit from Paged.js?

  Your current PDF generation is very robust, using Playwright to "print" a React-rendered HTML page
  to a PDF. This is a great system, but Paged.js offers a different, more specialized approach that
  could provide significant benefits, especially for a product focused on high-quality menu design.

  1. Advanced Typographic and Layout Control (The Biggest Win)

  This is the core advantage. Your current system renders one long webpage and then tells a browser to
  chop it up into A4-sized chunks. Paged.js thinks in pages from the start. This unlocks advanced
  print-layout features that are very difficult to achieve with a standard web-to-PDF approach:

   * Running Headers/Footers: Imagine a menu where the category name ("Appetizers," "Main Courses") is
     automatically printed at the top or bottom of every page that contains items from that category.
     This is a classic print design feature that Paged.js handles with simple CSS.
   * Dynamic Page Numbers: Easily add "Page X of Y" counters.
   * Fine-Grained Page Break Control: You can use CSS to prevent a category title from being left alone
     at the bottom of a page (an "orphan") or a single line of an item's description from starting at
     the top of a new page (a "widow").
   * Multi-Column Layouts: Create complex, magazine-style layouts that flow content from one column to
     the next and from one page to the next.

  2. A True "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) Live Preview

  Currently, your MenuPreview component likely shows a web representation of the menu. The user has to
  click "Generate PDF" to see the final, paginated result.

  With Paged.js, the live preview in your menu editor could be the actual Paged.js output. The user
  would see in real-time exactly where the page breaks will occur, how the running headers look, and
  what the final page count is. This is a massive improvement to the user experience, turning the
  editor from a form into a true design tool.

  3. Simpler, More Declarative Templates

  Your PDF templates could become more focused on clean, semantic HTML and powerful CSS. Instead of
  complex React logic to try and manage layout, you would define the pagination rules declaratively in
  your CSS. This can make the templates easier to create, maintain, and debug.

  Recommendation

  For the immediate pre-launch phase, stick with your current Playwright implementation. It is
  incredibly well-engineered, robust, and it works. Introducing a new rendering engine now would be a
  major architectural change and would jeopardize your launch timeline.

  However, for a post-launch or v2 roadmap, you should strongly consider Paged.js. The advanced layout
  capabilities and the potential for a true WYSIWYG editor are killer features that would significantly
   differentiate your product. You could market these as "Professional" or "Designer" templates,
  potentially tying them to a higher-priced subscription tier.

  In summary, Paged.js is a specialized tool that is perfectly suited to the core purpose of your
  application. While your current system is excellent, Paged.js offers a path to an even more powerful
  and user-friendly product in the future.
